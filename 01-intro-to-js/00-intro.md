-> we can use js in browser and on system(Server) usign NODE


JavaScript futures
- Asynchronous Nature.  (but we can use synchronous also)
- Event-Driven Architecture.
- Single-Threaded Working.
- Scalability.
- Multiple platform compatibility.

JS Follows ECMAScript standard. 

> ES5: Introduced significant enhancements to the language, including strict mode, JSON support, and several Array methods like forEach, map, filter, and reduce. (extra like find, findIndex)

> ES6 (ES2015): Introduced major features like arrow functions, let and const for variable declaration, template literals, classes, and modules.

 . . . . . 

> ES12 (ES2021): Brought features like private class methods and fields, Promise.any(), String.prototype.replaceAll(), and Logical Assignment Operators (||=, ??=, &&=).



- memory Leak : issue like Globle Variables

- WEB APIs : Java Script is Singe Threaded (Synchronous) single stack and single Heap Memory
