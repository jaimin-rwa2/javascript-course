> ES5: Introduced significant enhancements to the language, including strict mode, JSON support, and several Array methods like forEach, map, filter, and reduce. (extra like find, findIndex)

> ES6 (ES2015): Introduced major features like arrow functions, let and const for variable declaration, template literals, classes, and modules.

> ES7 (ES2016): Brought minor improvements like the includes() method for arrays and the exponentiation operator (**).

 . . . . . 

> ES12 (ES2021): Brought features like private class methods and fields, Promise.any(), String.prototype.replaceAll(), and Logical Assignment Operators (||=, ??=, &&=).
